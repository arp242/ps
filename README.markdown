This is a fork of https://github.com/mitchellh/go-ps with the following changes:

- `Processes()` â†’ `List()`.
- `FindProcess()` -> `Find()`.
- Add `String()` method, and `List()` returns a `Processes` with `String()`.
- Return an error from `Find()` if a process doesn't exist instead of `nil, nil`.
